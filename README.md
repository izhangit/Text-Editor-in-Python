# Text-Editor-in-Python

-In this Python program, I created a simple text editor that will allow users to create, open, edit, and save text files. I used the tkinter module to created a graphical user interface (GUI) for our text editor.

-To run the program, simply execute the "text_editor.py" file. Once the program is running, you can create a new file by clicking on the "File" menu and selecting "New". You can then start typing your text in the editor window

-To open an existing file, click on the "File" menu and select "Open". This will bring up a dialog box where you can browse for the file you want to open.

-To save a file, click on the "File" menu and select "Save". If the file has not been saved before, you will be prompted to enter a file name and choose a location to save the file.

-You can also use the "Edit" menu to cut, copy, and paste text, as well as undo and redo changes.
